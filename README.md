# dev-hw-2

This assignment will only need to display stuff in the CL console. Therefore, there is no 'index.html', etc.

Instead, work inside 'index.js' (HW instructions in the comments there!).

To run your program, simply open the terminal (be sure you are in the correct directory, of course - you should see 'master' displayed there) and do: `node index.js` there. You should see the results of whatever you are `console.log()`-ing, similarly to how you might see it in a browser console.

You could also run the terminal directly from inside VS Code by hitting: 'ctrl/cmd + ~'. However, you probably want it to use _Git Bash_ and not _Powershell._ To change this, kindly hit 'ctrl/cmd + Shift + P' and do a 'fuzzy search' for something like: 'default terminal.' From there, you can select to use _Git Bash_ as the default terminal.

Alternatively, in Windoze, from the 'Explorer', you can right click on your folder for this HW and select the option that resembles: 'Open Git Bash Here.' This should open up a terminal for you and dump you into the correct directory.

_See 'fonts' folder to install some nice fonts that should work well._
